# ETL and Sales Analysis for Game-dev Endustry

### Objective
The objective of this ETL project is to efficiently extract, transform, and load (ETL) game sales data from multiple sources into a structured database, enabling comprehensive data analysis and reporting. This project aims to provide insights into game sales trends, performance metrics, and other key indicators to support data-driven decision-making in the gaming industry.

### Summary
This ETL project leverages SQL and Python to handle game sales data, ensuring accurate and timely data processing. The project involves several key steps:

#### Extraction: 
Data is extracted from various sources, including CSV files, APIs, and databases. Python scripts are used to automate the extraction process, ensuring data is consistently retrieved and stored.

#### Transformation: 
Extracted data undergoes cleaning and transformation processes to standardize formats, handle missing values, and create meaningful aggregations. SQL is utilized for complex data manipulation and normalization, while Python handles initial data cleaning and preparation.

#### Loading: 
The transformed data is loaded into a relational database, designed for efficient querying and analysis. SQL is used to create and manage database schemas, ensuring data integrity and performance.

#### Data Analysis: 
With the cleaned and structured data in place, various analytical techniques are applied to uncover insights. Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, is used for data visualization and analysis. SQL queries are crafted to generate reports and summaries of game sales trends, genre performance, regional differences, and other critical metrics.

By combining the strengths of SQL for data management and Python for automation and analysis, this project provides a robust solution for handling and interpreting game sales data. The insights derived from this project can help stakeholders in the gaming industry make informed decisions based on comprehensive data analysis.
